Yi Zhang is a 3rd year PhD candidate at the Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG), University of Warwick. Her research focuses on trustworthy AI, probabilistic robustness, safe generative modeling, and the robustness of vision–language foundation models.

Before starting her PhD, she obtained both her Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science and Technology from Beijing Language and Culture University. During her postgraduate studies, she worked as an NLP algorithm engineer at Didi Global and an intern researcher at ByteDance AI Lab, where she developed multilingual dialogue understanding systems and conducted research on safety risk detection and conversational AI.

Her recent work includes publications at top-tier conferences such as ICCV 2025 and ECCV 2024, with research contributions spanning probabilistic adversarial training, robustness verification, and foundation model safety. She is a recipient of the Warwick Star Award and the NVIDIA Academic Grant Program for Accelerating Innovation in Academia.

Yi’s broader research interest lies in building reliable and interpretable AI systems through the intersection of adversarial robustness, probabilistic modeling, and large-scale vision–language learning.
